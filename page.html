		<h2>About myself</h2>
		<p>Did Visual Basic and C# very early as child, learned C++ in 2013. First real projects doing videogame modding circa 2017 - 2019, all C++ with Qt and WinAPI</p>
		<p>Then in 2020 I pivoted to machine learning because I was interested in speech synthesis for creativity. Went from zero Python experience then to maintainer of TensorFlowTTS in 2021 where I contributed the then-first open source TTS model that output 44.1KHz audio.</p>
		<p>I went to uni 2019-2021 but dropped out to focus on machine learning aside from feeling like it was limiting me. I made TensorVox (C++ ML TTS app) and began freelancing, mostly just training and slightly modifying models until 2023 when I started working for Storyteller
		and went in deep into model research itself</p>
		<p>Now I focus on research in model architecture, training - and by that I mean mostly Transformers - for GenAI (mostly speech, but doing image and text too). Did you know I worked with GPTs before the ChatGPT hype? I finetuned GPT-J-6B back in 2021 with <a href="https://sites.research.google/trc/about/">TPU Research Cloud</a> (back then Tensorflow Research Cloud) TPUs.

					<p>GLU variants have been the dominant activation function for the feedfowards in Transformers. Here, inspired by an element of KANs, I propose a parametric ReLU<br><br>
					Early tests shows faster convergence than SwiGLU at the cost of slightly lower per-step time and more VRAM usage.

					<img src="resources/aligns.png" alt="Project Interface" class="medium-img">
					<p>Most modern TTS models are incapable of modeling erratic, emotional speech; using FastSpeech2 as a base, I find out this is because they are not resilient to time series. Also, I pile on some of my Transformer upgrades and some others.<br><br>
					Introducing a duration predictor with 2xConv and 1xLSTM paired with a duration discriminator (not shown in paper). Currently incomplete due to lack of compute.

					<p>Many frontends for using Stable Diffusion models on local PC exist, but practically all of them are in Python and necessitate ~10GB of libraries installed via conda/pip that can break at any time.<br><br>
					This is a Stable Diffusion/SDXL program written in C++/Qt, without Python dependencies. Easy to install and lightweight, it makes local image generation accessible to people with minimal tech knowledge. Supports text-to-image, img2img and inpainting

					<img src="resources/p2interface.png" alt="Project Interface" class="medium-img">
					<p>Tacotron 2 is a text-to-speech model, still very popular and one of the first to become so. However, its autoregressive RNN architecture makes it prone to attention problems<br><br>
					Many techniques have been already applied to help in this aspect. Here, leveraging recent advancements, I propose mine, which is more flexible, and simple to integrate.

					<p>Few programs for using modern text-to-speech models locally exist, and those that do are in Python and require a bunch of dependencies<br>
					Since I also got into freelancing training and selling voice models, I needed and made a C++/Qt program that was easy and lightweight to install and use for neural TTS.<br>
					Supports both PyTorch (exported with TorchScript) and Tensoflow (Tensorflow SavedModel), multiple languages and phonemizers (ARPA, GlobalPhone, IPA), includes spectrogram, waveform views, and can do multi-threaded generation<br><br>
					Almost 200 stars on GitHub, and succesfully delivered to all kinds of customers for years while I was freelancing.

					<p>There's a geopolitical strategy game called SuperPower 2, which supports modding.<br><br>For modifying the database, there is a tool called "GLEditor" provided; however, it is extremely glitchy and crashy due to it being antiquated; its subset of C++ was already long out of support by that time<br>
					With help from the game maker who provided the original database interaction code, I rewrote both the interface and "database interaction" in modern C++<br>
					Since its release, it has become the de-facto database modding tool for the SuperPower 2 community.
