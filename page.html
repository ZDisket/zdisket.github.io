					<p>Many frontends for using Stable Diffusion models on local PC exist, but practically all of them are in Python and necessitate ~10GB of libraries installed via conda/pip that can break at any time.<br><br>
					This is a Stable Diffusion/SDXL program written in C++/Qt, without Python dependencies. Easy to install and lightweight, it makes local image generation accessible to people with minimal tech knowledge. Supports text-to-image, img2img and inpainting

					<img src="resources/p2interface.png" alt="Project Interface" class="medium-img">
					<p>Tacotron 2 is a text-to-speech model, still very popular and one of the first to become so. However, its autoregressive RNN architecture makes it prone to attention problems<br><br>
					Many techniques have been already applied to help in this aspect. Here, leveraging recent advancements, I propose mine, which is more flexible, and simple to integrate.

					<p>Few programs for using modern text-to-speech models locally exist, and those that do are in Python and require a bunch of dependencies<br>
					Since I also got into freelancing training and selling voice models, I needed and made a C++/Qt program that was easy and lightweight to install and use for neural TTS.<br>
					Supports both PyTorch (exported with TorchScript) and Tensoflow (Tensorflow SavedModel), multiple languages and phonemizers (ARPA, GlobalPhone, IPA), includes spectrogram, waveform views, and can do multi-threaded generation<br><br>
					Almost 200 stars on GitHub, and succesfully delivered to all kinds of customers for years while I was freelancing.

					A Chess Titans clone made with C++, using Irrlicht for the 3D and SFML for sound, as well as Qt for a launcher (the game itself uses console arguments). Tested in both Windows and Linux (Kubuntu). The AI is not mine.

					<p>There's a geopolitical strategy game called SuperPower 2, which supports modding.<br><br>For modifying the database, there is a tool called "GLEditor" provided; however, it is extremely glitchy and crashy due to it being antiquated; its subset of C++ was already long out of support by that time<br>
					With help from the game maker who provided the original database interaction code, I rewrote both the interface and "database interaction" in modern C++<br>
					Since its release, it has become the de-facto database modding tool for the SuperPower 2 community.

					<h4>MFA duration extraction for FastSpeech2</h4>
					<p>I helped implement Montreal Forced Aligner-based duration extraction for FastSpeech2, eliminating the need for a teacher model. I had just started learning Python, so my code was not used directly.</p>
